A simple NeuroEvolution demo. Uses naive evolutionary algorithm + DNN to generate an AI controller capable of solving a simple puzzle.

## Building Project

Requires Visual Studio

- Download SFML-2.5.1 and extract to Dependency folder. https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/
- Open solution and build project
- Copy SFML dlls from bin folder to NeuroEvolution\Release and NeuroEvolution\Debug folders

## Future Work

- A less trivial game that will pose more of a learning challenge: More game concepts such as enemies, weapons, and stealth.
- Genome Save/Load Functionality
- Evolution of DNN architecture
