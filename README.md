Requires Visual Studio

- Download SFML-2.5.1 and extract to Dependency folder
- Copy SFML dlls from bin folder to NeuroEvolution\Release and NeuroEvolution\Debug folders
- Open solution and build project

## Future Work

- A less trivial game that will pose more of a learning challenge: More game concepts such as enemies, weapons, and stealth.
- Genome Save/Load Functionality
- Evolution of DNN architecture
